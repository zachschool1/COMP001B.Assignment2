			<h2>Equipment</h2>
			<h3>Electronics</h3>
			<img class="image-electronics" src="images/turn-it-up-to-11.png" alt="Spinal Tap's amps turning all the way up to 11">
			<p>Spinal Tap didn't really have to bother with fancy electronics. The one thing that was important was being able to <em>turn it up</em>! Spinal Tap focused on creating innovative amplifiers that surpassed everything else available at the time. Spinal Tap's amps would turn up to 11, while regular amplifiers would only turn up to 10. This helped Spinal Tap achieve the title of England's loudest band.</p>

			<h3>Stage Effects</h3>
			<img class="image-stage-effects" src="images/tiny-stonehenge.gif" alt="Spinal Tap rocking out with their amazing scale replica of Stonehenge">
			<p>Spinal Tap really knew how to put on a show. What could be more "rock" than an <em>actual rock</em>, and what rock is cooler than Stonehenge? Spinal Tap had a scale replica of Stonehenge on the stage. No one else was able to match their stage presence.</p>
